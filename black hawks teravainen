Even with Teravainen having scored against the Arizona Coyotes, Vermette didn’t remember much about him. As much hype as Teravainen has received locally, he’s still mostly an unknown elsewhere. Vermette has since become more familiar with Teravainen as a teammate and last game as a linemate. Like a lot of people, Vermette has quickly developed a favorable opinion of the 20-year-old Teravainen. 

“I saw a little bit of him playing against him, not that much,” Vermette said after practice on Tuesday. “I noticed he had good hands and was a skilled kid. I’ve had a chance to see him a little closer in practice. He’s not disappointing me. Playing the game, I thought he was really good. We had a couple of good chances. He’s a skilled guy for sure.” 

Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville is fully on board with Teravainen now, too. After placing Teravainen in the AHL to begin the season, bringing him up for 15 games, sending him back down, again recalling him and placing him in a bottom-6 role for 18 games, Quenneville decided to give Teravainen a larger role in the Blackhawks’ last game on Sunday. Teravainen was put on the second line and on the power play. 

Quenneville gained that confidence in Teravainen because he had seen enough of Teravainen’s vision, playmaking skills and defensive responsibility. It was time to give him more. 

“I think he’s evolved rather nicely where he gets a little bit more,” Quenneville said. “He’s progressed to where he’s comfortable. You kind of earn your way a bit as well. Whether it’s gaining trust or gaining confidence, I think more so in watching him play is what we’re looking for. Him having confidence and having trust with the pucks and his linemates and the system and the game.
